# Imbalanced-Dataset

# Introduction 


A datset which consists classes having large number data in one class and less number of data in other class, called imbalanced dataset. The machine learning model which is builded by the imbalanced dataset might be predicting the class having large dataset but works very poor on the class which has less dataset as compared to the large dataset. Though, model accuracy would be too high but it does not work for the target class which has less data. 

The credit card fraud detection project has been suffered due to these kinds of issues because as compared to the fraud transcation, the non fraudulent transcation is high. The other examples are manufacturing defect, rare disease diagnosis etc. We heard many fraud detection machine learning model has not been predicting the fraudulent cases and similarly, the deadly disease diagnosis prediction has also been less accuracy. 

# Problem statement


The imbalanced dataset is challenging  for the machine learning model.
